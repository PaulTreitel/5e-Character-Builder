```
Item (
	Name: string
	Description: string
	Rarity: enum (common, uncommon, rare, very rare, legendary, artifact)
	Magic: boolean
	Equippable: boolean
	Container: boolean
	Option Weight: float
	Option Gold Cost: integer
	Attunement: boolean
	Consumable: boolean
	Option Prerequisites: ???
	Option Features: array of ???
	Item type: enum (weapon, armor, ???)
)
```

Prerequisites and features will have to work as with the rest of the system and are entirely undecided. It's unclear what item types we will end up with
