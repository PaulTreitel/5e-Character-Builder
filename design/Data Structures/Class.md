# Class Choices

A class or subclass can have its own category of choices, such as Warlock Invocations, fighting styles, battle master maneuvers, and the like. There should be a way to store these so they can appear in different places (different class feature options, class-based feats, the ability to select options from another subclass's category, etc) in a write-once use-multiple manner.
